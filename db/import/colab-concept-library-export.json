You’ve chosen connected devices to make your life easier and help you save energy. We take the data from those connected devices and sensors in your home, use state-of-the-art machine learning to distill it into a set of simple actions: Go Green.</P>\n<P>What is “Going Green”?</P>\nGoing Green is a system that includes passive home environment signals that provide you real-time feedback on the impact your action is going have on your consumption, a “Smart Bill” to summarize and interpret the long-term impact of your “Go Green” Actions, and metrics for comparing your performance with other relevant populations.<br>\n<b><P>Example Scenario</P></b>\nDishwasher: Eric is about to put a dishwasher load on. He has two options, do the load now, if he has company coming over and needs dishes immediately, or go green by pressing the physical button if he’s not in a rush. Eric decides to let the system do the work of figuring out the most energy- and cost-efficient time to run his dishwasher. Later, when looking at his Smart Bill, he can see the impact of the times he went green and the times he didn’t translated into terms he understands: Dollars he could have saved and the energy impact he’s prevented. Good news is Eric doesn’t have to figure out how to translate that into his life, he just needs to Go Green more often. The devices themselves suggest the actions.\n<P>Text \"start\" to 720-961-2494 to begin.</P>",

You might want to save energy or save money on the bill, but don't know how individual decisions affect the final total, or what that looks like in the long run. This led us to make a prototype of a physical interaction with a home appliance that would “signal” an optimal / less optimal behavior,  basically a go-no go signal. Feedback from testing was positive but users didn't want an invasive signal and didn't envision at the moment querying further into why the signal was “go” vs. “no go.” \n<p>Larger impact actions might be upgrading appliances, or choosing to remodel house with more energy saving windows. We realized that consumers currently make that decision largely unaided. What if we could enhance this process?\n<p>We took the insight that consumers really don't want to spend more than 6 minutes making decisions about energy consumption, but they would want to have recommendations about what to change, and decided to target the bill pay process. We envisioned a Smart Bill which presents your monthly utilities bill in the context of a comparison to neighboring homes."

        "body" : "SHED is a deployable pop-up tool market for your neighborhood. We send you a fully-automated and prebuilt SHED to house your tools (especially dangerous ones) and those of your neighbors so you can share underutilized resources. \n\n<p>\nHOW TOKENS WORK: Each home pays into the SHED of their neighborhood individually on a subscription basis. This deposits tokens in their community’s SHED individual account. You don't see or count the tokens your SHED has, but they can be spent to rent tools from other SHEDs or to purchase new tools for your own SHED. \n<p>\nMOTIVATIONS: (1.) Clean up your garage/storage space by moving tools to a centralized location (2.) By sharing your tools, gain access to the tools of your neighbors. (3.) Keep dangerous tools away from children in the home (4.) Money from the subscription service goes towards cleaning and maintenance of your own tools. \n<p>\n#IOT: Used to connect the SHED to the network and keep information connected. \n<p>\n#BLOCKCHAIN: Harnessed to log payment info from each individual and also token accounting between SHEDS in a secure and fully automated location. Also used to account for tools being checked in and out so no one can steal tools or falsify entry data. \n<p>\nSIGN-UP: A SHED is sent to a neighborhood once 8 houses or more  have signed up to be SHED members. Neighborhood must have network connectivity access. Sign up process involves entering in address, payment and tool-ownership info. Once 8 homes have signed up, the SHED uses an algorithm to determine which house is the best one to host the SHED given location, lighting and yard size. It pings the owner of that house and asks for verification that they are still willing to host (they get a discount per month). Once that has been verified, the SHED ships.  SHED Recommends size of Shed Pod(s) based on tools, zoning,& space. Uses modular shipping containers. This whole process (other than SHED manufacturing) is fully automated to avoid overhead costs. \n<p>\nDEPLOYMENT: The SHED lands pre-loaded with lock boxes and electronic verification system in place. It then sends a notification to each SHED member to come deposit their tools. The tools are marked as \"\"checked-out\"\" by the owner until they are turned in for the first time. If the tool is not returned (or in this case deposited) within a given timeframe, charges begin for the owner as they would in the case of a late-returned item. Once tools are deposited they auto-lock as when checked-in. \n<p>\nENTERING SHED: If you want to enter a SHED, you press the \"\"request access\"\" button on your SHED phone app for a 6-digit verification key. Once you receive the key, you punch it into the key pad on the door. The key code works for only a short time-frame for security and is tied in with your personal account so we know who is entering. Info on people entering and leaving the SHED is sent via IOT to the Blockchain ledger. \n<p>\nRENTING A TOOL: You can check your SHED app before even going to the SHED to see if a tool is checked in or out. Once you arrive, the process for check out is much like entry. You say you want to check it out on your phone, you get an access code, you enter that into a keypad on a secure box housing the tool, and the box releases the tool for your use. Info on who has taken or returned a tool is sent via IOT to the Blockchain ledger. \n<p>\nRETURNING A TOOL: If you do not return the tool in a pre-determined time frame, you begin to be fined for usage. To return it, you reenter the SHED, put the tool back in the box (which auto-locks) and check the tool back in on your phone app. Info on who has taken or returned a tool is sent via IOT to the Blockchain ledger.  \n<p>\nOTHER SHEDS: If your SHED does not have the tool you need, but the next neighborhood over does, you can either spend inter-SHED tokens to rent a tool from another SHED or pay extra money to rent it. You request access to the neighboring SHED through your app and it sends a limited-time access code as normal. The amount of tokens needed for this exchange is tracked and transferred by the Blockchain ledger. The user is informed only if there is not enough SHED tokens to borrow the neighboring community's tool. \n<p>\nTOOL DEMAND: If a tool is in high demand, such as a snow-blower on a snowy day, there is surge pricing or bidding in order to gain access to the item first. The item also has a more limited rental time than normal-demand items. This is all fully automated to eliminate overhead. \n<p>\nOTHER CONTEXTS: Could also be a food co-op or really any neighborhood resource. Interesting applications in labor markets to exchange expertise. \n\n<p>\nNEXT STEPS: (1.) Validate with integration with blockchain: Accounting design / implementation and contracts implementation. (2.) Migrate mock-up of app from static to dynamic. (3.) Design SHED pods of varying size appropriate for a neighborhood. (4.) Build bidding system to let the SHED handle contractors available for automating work (Snow plowing, furnace maintenance, equipment maintenance).",

Would it be a B2B implementation, B2C retail or C2C sharing? \n<p>\nUltimately we decided on divide and conquer -- Andrew and Junning got to work on coding the software and the API to integrate technologies, Kate and Kate did market research and conducted user surveys. Through the 'doing' process we invalidated: \n1.) Our initial medical management idea would not be effective in stopping drug theft.  \n2.) C2C sharing would not be trusted by the community with no central management. \n3.) Blockchain tech is most useful if there's some reason to actually have the information shared beyond one person's record. So not just locking a gun up, but allowing insurance companies or lawmakers to track who opens/shuts the case as well. \n<p>\nWe did validate that we can reduce costs of tracking through a decentralized system that doesn't require monitoring.

Our goal was to make information already available in the workplace more tacit and real vs hidden\n<p>\nPrototype #1: \n<br>Genius Bar: A place that people can come for help. \n<br>Questions we asked: I’m exploring how to improve productivity in the workplace. Is there anything you worked on today that you could talk about? \n<br>Assumption: That workers needed help with projects today, but did not ask for it. That they’d like a place to come and get help without having to explicitly ask. \n<p>\nPrototype #2: \n<br>WaterCooler: Hotspot of activity \nRobotics, Ants & Neuroscience experts will be available to chat.  \n<br>Assumption: That workers need inspiration during the day to lead to productivity. We’re testing to see if work conversations will inherently come out? \n<br>Result: During conversation, “work topics” did not naturally arise, but we discovered that at IDEO, there are already natural “hotspots of activity”. By nature of sitting in certain areas, this indicates that people are available if help is needed. \n<p>\nPrototype #3:\nPersonal Prioritization Board: \n<br>Prioritize the 3 tasks that you’d like to get done today. We’ll create a big sign over their workspace to broadcast these priorities. \n<br>Assumption: We’d like to test people’s priorities vs the team’s priorities. That providing transparency on work priorities is beneficial for the team & individuals productivity. \n<br>Result: The teams felt the prioritization board was in the wrong form as it wasn’t in their face and not relevant to them since the all already knew what to work on. As a project manager, Ali wished the board would be visible for some of her teams. \n<p>\nDay 2: We conducted user interviews, built & tested our prototypes with users and reached an inflection point of whether we should keep the focus on the team or pivot to the individual. After doing some research on potential solutions already in the workplace, we realized that we needed to strengthen fulcrum’s benefit to the end user so that they’d use our platform. During our interviews, we discovered that: \n<br>- When people are passionate about their work, they’d like to be able to understand how to do it better\n<br>- There are disruptions that happen during the day - and people don’t want these automated out, but would like them to be compartmentalized\n<br>- Individuals or teams don’t want big brother - however, inputs that surface latent moments where productivity could be augmented would be helpful"

From this, we believed that we could remove the extreme bias that's inherently present in most reviews on a one dimensional scale (the star rating system) and transform it into a multi-dimensional representation of a serviceman's reputation. Reputation as a whole is still very much based in the stories that communities tell about you, and we wanted to harness this as much as possible. \n<p>\nWe believed that we could use AI in this pursuit in two ways: \n1) To pick out the preferences of a user in order to emphasize a particular aspect of a serviceman's reputation. \n2) To analyze the reviews in order to give a truly quantitative spin on the different dimensions of a repairman's performance. \nWe also got the opportunity to talk to specific stakeholders in the process, who educated us on certain factors that could take precedence in the design. From this we realized that a fully \"\"chatbot\"\"-esque interface (which was the original intention) would work poorly for emergency purposes, since multiple questions slows the process of getting what they want. Many also said, concerning the review system, that it was naturally a very biased and arbitrary process, thus confirming our original hypothesis. Beyond this, we also talked to Allan about how to display the information to the user, who suggested the importance of comparing the given results to an average/baseline.\n<p>\nIn designing the interface, we wanted to make it as simple and painless as possible. Hence, while we included buttons to indicate preference, we also allowed for simple pattern matching (AI in a more advanced, ideal prototype) to pick out the user's preferences from the natural language in the text and dynamically highlight these choices. Additionally, we took the info from the user stories in order to provide a clickthrough link for the top result, as well as the top five relevant reviews and a radar chart indicating the repairman's top preferences."

The tray demonstrates the modularity of our system because it could be placed in existing drug inventory cabinets. It is three light sensors connected to an arduino, connected to a nodejs process running locally on a mac os that continually sends http requests to a php application running on an aws server. The php application handles application logic and updating our database to maintain the physical state of the tray.

We even visited a senior community center to get a feel for the values of the Central Square community and look for opportunities.\n<p>\nWe learned about the journey of an incoming 311 request as well as all of the different factors that contribute to the prioritization of a 311 issue. We realized that there were two problems: how the citizens experience the 311 system in the form of communication and how the government makes decisions about 311 priorities (and how they try to take public sentiment into account). We wanted to explore the question of how we might measure and leverage public sentiment to provide better alignment in civic priorities, e.g. deciding which 311 issues to address when, or monitoring bike lane obstructions because the city of Cambridge cares about bikes. We also realized the solution needed to increase transparency around issue resolution with the public, e.g. If you report that your street needs to be cleaned, the city can immediately tell you its already been scheduled, so the citizen feels heard and knows the resolution."

We looked at methods to “smooth” the inherently disruptive transition between different educational environments. We had thought about a physical place as refuge for these emotions which later transitioned to a more remote and accessible app.  After extensive interviews with counselors, government officials in the DOJ and students we were convinced that anonymity and ease of access were important aspects to the project. Moving forward, greater focus could be dedicated to using A.I. to predict these situations allowing the student to more adequately prepare for the change in environment. \n<p>\nWe discussed how to get students to use this bot - which is important because it gets better as it receives more data. We thought about if students would rather use an app during a time required in class, or if it would be something done spontaneously. Our discussions with teachers led us to move away from a model that was too structured or disruptive to the school environment - we wanted the students to feel comfortable using the bot as a personal space. However, by allowing teachers (and potentially others) to view personal data, we introduced privacy concerns that warrant further exploration. \n<p>\nThe use of augmented reality as a way to visualize data dynamically was an exciting challenge - we assumed that the initial qualms expressed by teachers would subside as the hardware progressed, and focused on designing an experience for the future of AR. This also gave us a platform to visualize hidden insights from the AI. \""

This allows a central authority to know where all workers are at any time for both better tracking of how long they were out in the field and if they were in unsafe conditions if there are any complaints from OSHA, unions or lending energy companies. Next steps for this functionality are to add in a button so you can designate yourself when you are \"\"on,\"\" \"\"off,\"\" or \"\"lunch breaking,\"\" etc for better hour tracking. \n<p>\nThe second functionality is a vibration/impact sensor in the app. Every 10 seconds it uploads to the blockchain if there have been any dramatic impacts to the phone (like if you fall off a ladder or are hit by a truck). If this occurs, the central coordinator sees a red pin pop up on the map and for them to dispatch someone else to check up on them. Next steps for this functionality are to add a pop-up on worker screen if impact is detected asking if they are ok. A non-response will be assumed as a no.  \n<p>\nThe third functionality involves better updating conditions at work sites and then prioritizing them for workers. The map shows a series of pins: Green are low priority sites, yellow are mid-priority sites and red pins are where someone may have fallen or been hurt (as per last function). If you click on the pin, you can see more info on what is going on there and even some pictures. Color coded priority level is based on these reports. The app allows workers to update the pins of info from the field and add pictures in case conditions weren't what scouts originally described.  Next steps for this functionality are to build out a ranking system based on sensor data to help automatically deploy worker teams to the most important issues in a decentralized and automatic manner. This functionality will take into account what skills and tools are on each truck and allocate them to the issues they are able to tackle.",

(i.e. acquiring hotels, trailers, catering food etc.)\nThat one of the biggest problems is being able to damage assess as accurately as possible. The more accurate the assessment the more efficient the resource allocation can be deployed across the different substations, zones, and crew. We found that even with sensor data, on the ground scouts, and social media reporting, there is still a lot of ambiguity and guessing that goes into resource allocation. This led us to create an app that is from a bottom up approach. Empowering line workers to add resource orders to an immutable ledger for all OMS and ROD to be cross reference with. So lets say a line worker shows up to a job with Cretan resource from crew and equipment. They soon realize this job is much more than the original assessment and will need more linemen and equipment.

This broken system amounts to a “Catch 22” of sorts, through which an individual who is already in a poor financial situation cannot possibly borrow money to build credit without getting into an even worse situation.

After this, the two parties must verify that the conditions of the contract were met, and can add additional context to why a particular condition was met or not.

We’d created a model towards the beginning of this exploration of open reputation that seemed to hold true up to this point: that is, the flow of collecting data (subjective and objective), processing and modeling it, communicating it, and then using that information to make decisions. \nWe found the question of credit to be especially interesting due to its opaque nature and the possibility for high impact (specifically, the opportunity to give people second chances after failing the existing, entirely financially based system of credit ratings). Paired with the chance to flesh out the base of our process -- collecting data to build a reputation -- we felt that this would be a great concept to pursue for the final three days of the CoLab.\n<p>\nPROCESS\nThe concept of a “second chance” for those attempting to rebuild their credit was especially intriguing to us, and guided many of our thoughts at the beginning of the process. We honed in on a few key concepts: \nGathering information about credibility from more than just finances\nAdding context to this information by telling their story rather than presenting them as a number. \nIdentifying who is building their credit from nothing at all and those attempting to regain their credit in society. \nCredit as a proxy for TRUST.\nWe used the next day and a half to talk to a lot of people about these ideas, as well as key questions on how credit has played a role in their lives or work. These interviews were invaluable in determining exactly what problems we should be tackling -- and why. \nWe spent a lot of time trying to properly model these findings, so we did not have as much time to prototype. However, we did lay out everything we would need to do in order to create our ideal mock of our new system, which will be detailed in the appendix. We ended up prioritizing the most user facing components of our prototype: the Google Home conversational interface and the ideal look and feel of the data presented to the user (including the contract created). \n<p>\nANSWERS\nValidated: The idea of capturing informal transactions as inputs to build a stronger reputation"

This will assist consumers save money by lowering their energy bill and reduce their environmental footprint.\n\n2) Advisory services: Otak will have the ability to monitor energy patterns across devices to give consumers advanced notice of appliance failures. \n\n3) Smart Home services: Provide the ability to control the appliances, allowing on/off, start/stop, schedule and remote access functionality \n\nIn addition to consumer offerings, Otak will also have an industry offering to companies interested in energy usage data. Early target industries will be energy, insurance, banking, retail and home improvement.  For example, Home Depot would be interested in targeted advertisements to consumers with under-performing / inefficient appliances. This could be shared with companies via a subscription service using the hash key to the Nomad for real time data users and a packaged data files for periodic data users.  \n<p>\nHow it works: The OTAK device collects power usage data from different devices around the Home and  collects the data in a JSON format and packages it in real time. It then uses the Distributed peer to peer Network and Nomad to Publish the JSON file out to the world. Subscribers who are given the appropriate Hash Channel can then receive a specific OTAK Device’s JSON Files. The interval of file send and reception is approximately every 30 seconds depending on the peer population of the Network. \n",

Within the app, Jules would provide profile information, and the app would leverage data inputs such as battery state, weather, destination, google calendar information to match her to relevant offers provided by users such as utilities, municipalities, commercial & industrial users.  The platform would leverage data such as real time peak demand pricing, building energy management data, capacity needs, etc to present offers for ev owners.    \n\nWhen matches are made, transactions are captured in the Blockchain and EV owners receive Jule Coins for giving their energy.

In Myko's initial prototype, we explored connecting businesses currently have no way of having deeply rooted economic relationships.\n<p>\nThe usecase in this prototype highlights a relationship between a business and a coffee shop that currently have no way of interacting with each other. The two parties have the base factors in place for a symbiotic relationship: the coffee shop needs regular customers to survive, and the business needs to provide it's employees with fresh coffee and keep them in a healthy state of mind for working. In the prototype, two plinths with weight sensors act as atomic nodes streaming the sensor data over IPFS. Myko itself is a composite nomad node, a piece of software that consumes atomic node streams. The composite Myko node recieves data in realtime, and does logic process to determine how many cups of coffee have been poured, if there is a fresh pot of coffee now, or if the coffee on the plinth is old. When placing the plinths in both the business and the coffee shop, a relationship is created such that when the coffee shop has fresh coffee and the business' coffee is old, employees are sent over to the coffee shop for coffee and a walk outside. This way, the coffee shop recieves regular customers. The business model in this prototype can go even further to create a stable flow of income for the coffee shop by creating a central fund for the business' employees to pull money from when buying coffee from the shop. This fund would be paid for monthly by the business, creating income flow for the coffee shop.\n<p>\nA second Myko object is a button that sends out timestamped offers to all peers that subscribe to it. The usecase in the prototype is a small bakery that bakes fresh bread at certain time intervals, and wants to create demand around the freshness and scarcity of the goods as they degrade in quality. The button prototype manifests itself in another composite node which has a purchase button on it. When the button is tapped, a \"Hot buns\" notification is sent out across the network, and starts a timer tracking how long the buns have been out of the oven. The node displays a price that dynamically changes as time goes on; when buying hot buns, the price is higher, when buying cold buns the price is lower.\n<p>\nBoth of these concepts excite us about the opportunities they represent from a machine automation standpoint. What would happen if we instrumented factory machines with stress sensors that empowered them to automatically purchase replacement parts for themselves so they continue to run at optimum efficiency? If the machines are connected and communicating with eachother in realtime, can they coordinate a group buy of parts to get a discount?\n<p>\nNext steps with these prototypes are to pilot them in different usecases to test scalability and feasibility of nomad nodes that instrument environments.",

        "body" : "In order to incentivize societally beneficial actions, we created a decentralized market place called Recoin. It is a renewable energy credit system that incentivizes drivers of electric vehicles by providing social consumers an opportunity to purchase recoins as a means of offsetting carbon emissions. \nIn order for recoin to succeed there must be a supply and demand of recoins. We identified two key stakeholders in this process: the electric vehicle (EV) drivers and the buyers of recoins, labeled as “the social consumers”. Through user interviews we identified two key insights. For the EV drivers, the recoin process must be completely automated for greater adoption. For adoption among the social consumers, small but frequent opportunities to offset carbon emissions are more effective. \nThe process is initiated when a EV driver pairs their car to the recoin system. A tracking system will automatically generate a recoin for each mile that is driven by the EV. The recoin is associated with a blockchain ID and placed onto the marketplace. As the recoins are purchased from the marketplace, the EV driver will be passively accruing money. The EV driver has two options, they can simply watch their electric miles turn into money, or they can choose to donate a % of their earnings to the charity of their choice. The information and options associated with these decisions are found on the “marketplace” and “recoins for good” section of the recoin app. \nFor the non-EV driver, we prototyped how the recoin system could be integrated into their daily lives through their Uber usage (this behavior can extend to other examples such as amazon purchases and lyft rides). By opting into recoin, a social consumer is prompted to offset the CO2 emissions from their most recent Uber ride through a phone notification that pops up immediately after completing an Uber ride. This would be a micro-transaction that would only add cents to the total price of the Uber trip. From user interviews we identified that micro-transactions that are viewed as socially impactful will drive adoption. The more Uber miles that are offset by recoin, will make the value of recoins rise. As a result, there is more incentive to drive an electric vehicle and be a “miner” of recoins.",

We assessed a potential solution around creating a test market that would illustrate the value of recoins on a few different levels.  Multiple variables contributed to how the value could fluctuate based on market dynamics via a basic supply and demand economic scale.  In order to create a market, we needed to start with some baselines that were estimated based on extensive data gathering, but before any of this could happen, validation on user assumptions at a larger scale (that we made on our first Sprint) needed to occur.  We did this via a survey in which we had over 200 respondents using various channels.  This survey gauged users' brand and other preferences, frequency of use, emotion, price points, emotional components and more specific questioning related to pollution and options around our solution.    \nA lot of our market tests hover around the use of Uber and electric vehicle figures, so we looked at a great deal of data and trends to make more accurate assumptions.  It should be noted that we kept this within the United States  Demand is created via businesses buying into the system or a large amount of microtranasactions accounting for a large impact.  Our supply is solely created via electric vehicle drivers.  Outside of these two main components, we weighted other large businesses such as Amazon and Whole Foods buying into our concept and how the market would fluctuate accordingly.  A major challenge that we would like to continue to explore is around the concept of \"retiring\" the coins.  We simplified this market drastically allowing for coins to immediately retire, but we do worry that some of the value we are exploring could be lost.  In the end, our main goal was to incent beneficial actions that impact all of society.  Our test market allows room for both to occur.  As a result, our prototypes illustrates a real-time recoin market that adjusts based on actions in the market.

There are countless data sources  -- from financial data such as bank statements, Vemno/Paypal, Crypto Wallets to Resumes, Academic transcripts, Employer references, prior landlord referrals, and personal references -- that can demonstrate credibility for someone in this demographic.  Glasscred is an alternative solution to credit score that can be used with landlords, potential employers, and loan organizations.  Glasscred combines payment history with important documents to demonstrate an individual’s credibility. A diverse set of inputs help form a comprehensive profile of users’ spending patterns and income sources. On the backend, Glasscred requests access to users’ different accounts and uses this information to construct a user profile.

This sprint, we were investigating ways to take the pressure of installing these sensors off of the city and instead placing it into the hands of people. To address this challenge, we created Vida, an all inclusive sensor module that contains a camera used for security, monitoring foot and vehicle traffic, and monitoring the availability of street parking, an air quality sensor, and a noise sensor. The idea is we would market this module to the consumer as a security device to keep your home safe, but the consumer can opt-in to share the data gathered by his/her Vida with the city. In return, the city provides access to the aggregate data from multiple Vidas, overlayed over a real time \"digital-twin\" of the city. Maybe the city also provides a tax break or something. What you end up with is a satisfied consumer with a safer home, and a more efficient city with real-time aggregate data.",

Share pricing structures can be codified into smart contracts, allowing for desirable pricing flexibility for both new artists and established stars. New artists can provide for low/no-cost sharing upon release of a new song to incentivize sharing and building up of a follower base, with specific increase in pricing as popularity rises.

We began to build a UI for it, and gathered a lot of really interesting feedback.  We also realized that we were building a product rather than focusing on an experience.  So we focused on trying to understand how we could reframe our understanding of micropayments.  We developed this hypothesis: micropayments work when you receive a coin for doing what makes that coin valuable.  Said another way, micropayments don't work on their own, they work as park of a market protocol.  We need to think of micropayments as a proof of ability, rather than an expression of money. \n\nTo that end, we started to build a new email token protocol, where you pay for email exchanges.  The use cases of this token would be that you could pay to surface your email in someone else's inbox, that you could guarantee it was read, you could create new marketing metrics, and you could tip content creators with this coin. \n",

However intelligent agents are much more than just an interface humans can speak with using language, they are autonomous entities which observe their environment through sensors and act upon it using some sort of actuators (i.e. it is an agent). Most bots direct these activities towards achieving goals and can learn or use knowledge to achieve these goals better. The most simple version of an intelligent agent is actually something like a thermostat. For this reason, we wanted to move away from a language interface and really focus on how intelligent agents can allow us to outsource part of our agency to a machine so that it can make a limited range of decisions based on available data. This automation saves users time and mental fatigue, allowing them to setup preferences once and then acts according to those wishes until the constraints are changed.", "One area where we though this would be very useful is helping to collect, exchange, and receive compensation for human's unique sensorium, the collection of senses they have and what those senses can observe.

With this in mind, we are assuming that auto manufacturers can query a list of cars and filter by specific parts (or sets of parts). In the event of a recall, the auto manufacturer flags impacted vehicles, triggering an alert to the car. When the notification is received the car determines an appropriate course of action. Leveraging the matching conditions used in the “BikeChain” prototype, the car compiles a list of convenient dealership service locations for the maintenance to be performed. The driver / owner then “chats” with the car to work out an appropriate service solution (location and scheduling). Once the driver / owner makes a selection, the car automatically books an appointment with the dealership service department by reserving time on the online calendaring system. This action could also trigger an action with the manufacturer, who would then send the part to the designated service location. Once the new part is loaded into the car, it is associated with the car, updating the blockchain records and triggering payment to the franchised dealership service provider. ",

        "body" : "We imagine a future in which individuals own and maintain their own digital presence, including the data they generate. Rather than large companies scraping, selling, and restricting access to our online actions, individuals will be in control of their data and can use it to create richer digital agents that understand our tastes and make more informed recommendations.\n<br /><br />\nME.AI is an e-commerce experience that curates products and other digital content in a contained and private environment. You begin with a blank store and connect social media profiles such as Instagram and Linkedin to build your AI. Over time, your AI will evolve visually and “mentally” by continuing to collect your interests and motivations from activity across your browser. It also learns as you interact with items in your “store,” allowing you to give quick feedback on whether you hate or love products. \n<br /><br /><br />\n\n<b><u>Key Features</u></b>\n<br /><br />\nFeatures in prototype:\nOnboarding to Capture Shopping Intent and Relevant Personas: Basic questions that collect the user’s shopping goal and current frame of mind (e.g. What color best represents your mood right now?) to create a semi-personalized first look. We also envision the next prototype to include the step of linking your social media profiles so ME.AI can improve recommendation accuracy based on personas generated from your data.\n<br /><br />\n<b>Taste Forking Filter:</b> After onboarding, the user is prompted to select (or “fork”) taste profiles — personas, interests, influencers, and top friends —that they identify with. The site then pulls curated products based on the user’s forked tastes to populate the curated shop. This feature explores the “cold start” issue when a user has no prior training or specific taste preferences, instead “forking” preexisting training and tastes to kick off their product exploration.\n<br /><br />\n<b>Curated Shop:</b> The user’s shop consists of curated products based on forked tastes as well as customized imagery to create a visual experience like browsing an aesthetic magazine. The shop’s hero image and taglines are sourced from onboarding questions, establishing that the store is not only curated for the user, but owed by the user. Additional banner images are sourced from forked taste profiles. The user also has the option to customize additional imagery through the unsplash API.\n<br /><br />\n<b>Product Preference Training:</b> As the user provides feedback to train ME.AI, it will continue to improve the accuracy of its product recommendations through machine learning. Scrolling below the curated shop, the user can explore a much larger grid of products. As the user hovers over each product, 5 emojis, ranging from happy to sad, pop up so the user can provide feedback over each product. Each emoji applies a different opacity to the product (visible as normal for love, almost transparent for hate), rendering a visual map for the user’s tastes. The emotive training provides a much more robust data set for product preference, encoding ranges of emotive responses from very positive, to neutral, to very negative. \n<br /><br />\n<b>Visualizing ME.AI Evolution:</b> Since AI evolution happens in the backend over time, typically with few immediate and noticeable difference on the frontend, users often get discouraged and stop training the AI. In ME.AI, as the user applies emotive training, a colored shape in the top right of the header begins to “evolve” by changing color and growing in size to visualize training progress, thereby getting immediate feedback that the training is adding value.\n<br /><br />\n<b>Purchase Direct from Retailer (not built into the prototype):</b> When the user clicks on ‘Buy,’ the platform redirects him to a retailer site to complete the purchase. In this way, retailers can build a consistent brand experience and direct relationship with the user, instead of being reliant upon Amazon. Your ME.AI also already has your credit card information so you would not have to re-enter it on the retailer site.\n<br /><br /><br />\n\n<b><u>Fun Terms</u></b>\n<br /><br />\nPersona Tags \n\t<i>The aspects of any human's personality, behaviors, or tastes that can be determined through online activity. Think richer demographics created based on true passions or interests.</i>\n<br /><br />\nActive Data\n\t<i>Pieces of information reflecting a person’s taste, collected via active input. An interface may be deliberate and concrete in telling the person that their actions are actively feeding an AI.</i>\n<br /><br />\nPassive Behavioral Data\n\t<i>Data that does not obviously lead to some interface change in the mind of the user. This includes social media likes, posts, and images posted as a part of a normal day.</i>\n<br /><br />\nAI Training\n\t<i>The human interface side of providing data to a machine learning model. This can be gamified, collected passively, or used as a tool to learn collaboratively with the AI.</i>\n<br /><br />\nAI Evolution\n\t<i>The notion that as you train your AI, a user can visually observe the progress of the machine learning model, abstracted from the actual technical detail.</i>",

This data is then sold to advertisers and retailers that use it to integrate “targeted” ads into our online experience. There is little possibility of providing feedback to eliminate poor recommendations or expand upon excellent recommendations.\n<br /><br />\nIn online retail, Amazon-like platforms make recommendations primarily based on your past transaction and click history. These factors limit recommendations, especially in new categories in which you have never purchased. ME.AI leverages cross-domain passive social media data to create richer personas that improve the accuracy of product recommendations. These include more than transaction history and extend to linkedin job roles, instagram followers, and twitter interests. \n"

        "body" : "Recognizing the significant risk to automakers and consumers incurred by counterfeit airbags, BlokMotiv uses traceability of parts to dissolve illicit markets, improve consumer safety, and reduce manufacturer loss. In doing so, it also provides a provide framework for future autonomous applications. <br><br>\n\nAirbags are generally composed of three main components: the inflator, cushion, and cover. Airbag counterfeiting typically occurs when these components are stolen (either from the factory or directly from vehicles) and reassembled into what is called a “Frankenstein” airbag. For instance, a “Frankenstein” airbag might include a Ford cover, a Honda cushion, and a Toyota inflator. Since all of these components are optimized for a specific vehicle, this can make for a deadly combination. Mechanics and other consumers purchase these fraudulent units through standard ecommerce channels, such as Ebay, often unknowingly. When installed into the vehicle, the driver has no idea that this safety-critical part will not function properly, and could injure or kill them during a crash. <br><br>\n\nAirbag manufacturers put their products through stringent quality assurance practices and carefully track the inflator, cushion, and cover as they are assembled and put into vehicles. Today, manufacturers use barcode stickers, engraved serial numbers, and other traditional inventory practices to track parts. These methods are manual, static, and difficult to manage. By replacing these options with RFID tags, we can create new opportunities to more efficiently and precisely track airbag components. <br><br>\n\nRFID is a standard technology to digitally track physical objects. After analyzing the market of existing solutions, we identified an opportunity to create “aggregated identities” for machines—which is the packaging of a unique combination of three or more tags. Blokmotiv airbags are RFID tagged by inflator, cushion and cover, and those parts are combined to create a singular “part identity.” This approach offers significant security advantages compared to existing approaches (e.g. placing a label on the packaging). Since only this specific combination of individual components constitutes an authentic airbag, our approach prevents the creation of “Frankenstein” airbags. <br><br>\n\nBlokmotiv Merkle Trees are used to establish an aggregated identity based on the individual components that form a part. Merkle Trees are great data structures for this system, because they enable the <i> order </i> of part assembly to be tracked. Furthermore, we can store the components’ respective Merkle proofs in the RFID tags themselves. With this information, we can distinguish exactly which specific component was invalid in the event of a fraudulent scan. <br><br>\n\nWhen the RFID tags on the inflator, cushion, and cover are scanned together at the point of manufacture, this aggregated identity gets posted to the BlokMotiv blockchain ledger. When the airbag is later installed into a vehicle, an in-car RFID sensor reads the combination and checks the validity against the ledger. If a record match is found, the airbag identity is digitally coupled with the vehicle identity on the blockchain. If it is not found, the unsuccessful install attempt is also logged onto the blockchain. If the vehicle is ever in an accident that causes the airbag to deploy, that deployment event is written to the airbag’s blockchain record, preventing this retired asset from being reused. <br><br>\n\nThe BlokMotiv blockchain is a semi-private blockchain - while anyone (including the public) can read from the blockchain with the necessary APIs, only particular stakeholders can write to it. Write access is controlled by the OEM (e.g. Ford), who can authorize the airbag manufacturers, as well as its manufactured cars, to register manufacture and install events onto the blockchain. Public read access allows for consumer transparency, and also for other secondary stakeholders like insurance companies, to take action on the information available on the ledger. <br><br>\n\nFor blockchain prototyping, we used Tierion’s API. The current technical constraints around blockchain systems, such as block size and verification times, present possible limitations for scaling the platform. More research into the most appropriate distributed ledger technology (DLT) would be required to move forward. <br><br>\n\nInstalling a fraudulent airbag flags that unit as inauthentic, triggering alerts to the OEM, the airbag manufacturer, the driver, and the insurer. This process maintains shared truth that allow different parties to take the appropriate corrective action. <br><br>\n\nIn addition to validating the authenticity of airbags at the point of install, different stakeholders can access the BlokMotiv ledger of shared truth for a variety of applications. Individual owners can check the history of parts of their current or future vehicle. Insurers can query their client’s vehicles and set premium rates based on the vehicle owner’s use of authentic parts. Brand protection teams across the auto industry can share information on fraudulent installs to identify counterfeit sources. If a recall needs to be issued, manufacturers can precisely trace recalled parts to their respective  owners with much greater accuracy. Finally, looking towards a future of autonomous transportation, a system like Blokmotiv could be used to monitor parts installed in these vehicles and guarantee that they are genuine.\n",

        "body" : "<strong>Overview:</strong><br> \nCredo is a decentralized credit-decisioning platform which enables the 70mm credit-thin consumers in the US to prove their financial responsibility through alternative credit data, verified by the data provider in real time. The prototype specifically demonstrates that a credit-thin user can request and own their verified utility payment data from Exelon so that Ford can access and trust it when making a credit decision. Lenders like Ford may typically rely on credit bureaus for scoring, which don’t include information like utility, rent, and telecom payment history. For consumers who don’t have loans or debt, this is often the only financial data they generate. \n<br><br>\n\n<strong>Decentralized Identities:</strong><br> \nThe prototype is based on the Blockstack protocol, through which each of the parties creates an identity. Users can link a personal database (Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon Cloud, phone/hardware storage, etc.) where their payment history data will be stored. Blockstack IDs were created for the user, Exelon, and Ford. \n<br><br>\n\n<strong>Profile Setup:</strong><br>\nUsers log into Credo, which registers a Blockstack ID, and they then link their bank account(s). Credo scrapes their bank statements (using the Plaid API) in order to identify recurring payments that could prove financial responsibility. Based on these recurring payments, Credo makes API endpoints in the user’s personal database. Through these endpoints, data providers can sign, hash, and post the user’s payment history and lenders can view this data. One of these API endpoints corresponds to Exelon utilities data.\n<br><br>\n\n<strong>Pulling Verified Data:</strong><br>\nWhen a thin-file user needs to prove their creditworthiness to a lender, in this case Ford, through alternative payment data, they can use Credo to prove that their data was verified from the issuing source and was not altered. They can directly request the corresponding data provider, in this case Exelon, to post digitally signed payment data to their personal databases via their API endpoints. The prototype mocks up the process of the user signing a smart contract that ensures the data provider will be paid whenever someone accesses the verified data they have posted to the user’s database. Then the data provider (Exelon), represented by an EC2 server, signs, hashes, and posts data to the user endpoint. \n<br><br>\n\n<strong>Verified Data Access:</strong><br>\nThe user then goes through a mocked up experience of granting the lender, Ford, access to their data. When making a credit decision, Ford can actually see the signed data in the user’s personal database and can therefore trust that the data has not been altered. If the data is tampered with, the data hash will no longer match the hash produced by the data provider.\n\n",

This makes the data incomplete.", "Credit-decisioning data needs to have not just trusted sources, but trusted predictability of financial behavior." ],
        "why" : "<strong>Problem:</strong><br>\nDespite the credit system being over 100 years old, it has changed very little over time. As attitudes towards ownership and credit change, the current inputs that build credit―bank loans, auto loans, and credit cards―are becoming increasingly less representative of the American population. Thus, the credit system is becoming less effective at quantifying risk. According to a study done by Upstart and Transunion, more than 4 in 5 Americans have never defaulted on a loan, yet less than half of them have access to prime credit. Tough regulations, misaligned incentives, and difficulties verifying that data has not been altered is preventing the credit system from adapting to the way people live today.\n<br><br>\n\n<strong>Opportunity:</strong><br>\nThere is plenty of alternative credit data siloed within different organizations such as utilities, telecom, etc. However, directly sharing data between companies in order to make credit decisions is heavily regulated. These same organizations choose to not participate in the credit system because they have no business incentive to do so. In order to get around that, credit-thin people usually print out bills that they believe will prove their creditworthiness and present them to lenders. However, there is nothing ensuring that the data has not been altered in the process, so lending agents cannot trust it. \n<br><br>\n\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br>\nCredo enables thin-file people to prove their financial responsibility by bridging the gap between companies that hold payment data and lenders that want to see that data. At the user’s request, data providers can post cryptographically signed, alternative credit data to the user’s personal database. This is key, since instead of asking companies to push data into Credo, we’re enabling the user to pull and own it. Then, with the user’s permission, lenders can pay data providers a small fee in order to access the verified data in the user’s database. By making the user the custodian of their data and the bridge between the data provider and lender, Credo helps circumvent regulations around sharing data directly between companies. In the end, data providers get to monetize previously stagnant data, lenders get access to data they can trust in order to expand their customer base, and thin-file people are empowered to prove their creditworthiness and get better rates. \n"

What would that world look like, what would have to be true for this to happen? To start let’s take a walk down memory lane. \n<p>\nIn early 1900 our energy grid infrastructure mainly moved power from A to B, in a centralized fashion. Today our grid is much more sophisticated with multiple points of supply, types of supply (renewable and non-renewable), and all the while highly variable throughout the day. \n<p>\nMore and more we’re seeing solar power production advancing which is great, however, we’re in the beginnings of a massive storage problem, effectively solar harvesting occurs during the day while demand is low and without adequate storage, this power is wasted (pushed to the ground). \n<p>\nAs our team considered these barriers we explored arbitraging energy using consumer Evs with the hope of creating a mobile power bank. As we verified through research most vehicles have very low utilization rates (especially consumer EV’s), and even more true with certain municipal sedans, and light-duty trucks. After speaking to our utility members, electric vehicle drivers, and learning about the electric grid Battery Technology in decentralized networks it became apparent the infrastructure cost and the at the consumer level far exceeds the benefits even in the near-term. After this realization we considered consumer fleets as the primary customer, it became apparent that the predictable schedules overnight storage in a centralized location and already available infrastructure would make consumer fleets how much more viable storage solution a large capacity\n<p>\n\nAfter speaking with the San Francisco Municipal Fleet, ChargePoint, Ford Global strategy, Exelon, Duke Energy, and Southern Company we verified that commercial fleets would be a viable alternative for storing energy in a decentralized fashion. That said we started prototyping predictive models to approximate the availability of battery storage within consumer fleets.\n\n<p><u>\nStakeholder incentives</u>\n<p>\nBy communicating available supply via battery storage utilities would be able to take proactive measures to combat surplus production resulting in saving money. Fleet managers also have an incentive to store power in these latent batteries while the vehicles are parked. Stored power can then later be sold back to the grid during high demand times all the while fleet vehicle remain dormant. Based on our algorithm the vehicles would still achieve their full charge for their duty cycle for the next day.",

In order to facilitate the flow of people, the city needs to be able to respond to anomalies in a timely manner. The city's existing system is highly manual and analog. Making this system more responsive calls for both a top-down and bottom-up approaches: building a digital twin of a city starts with the citizens. By consistently measuring the actions of individual citizens, we can create and improve in real-time a digital model of the entire city. The benefits are two-fold: it would enable citizens to move around the city fluidly and help the city to better allocate resources and plan for the future. \n<p>\nHow Gui works:\n<p>\nGui aggregates multiple data sources to provide useful transit information for the multi-modal commuter. The data sources include:\n1- Public transit disruptions reported by cities transit authorities (e.g. MBTA API)\n2- Hyperlocal Weather Predictions (e.g. Dark Sky hyperlocal weather forecasts)\n3- Occupancy in buses, trains, subway stations, and spaces (can be measured using computer vision techniques used on existing camera feeds)\n<p>\nCategorizing anomalies: <p>\nGui deconstructs each commute into segments based on modes of movement: walk, bike, subway, bus, etc. Based on these modes of transportation, Gui can categorize the types of anomalies that are relevant to the specific leg of a user’s commute. For example, walking and biking will be affected by rain whereas taking the subway will not; the lack of seating on a bus may deter the user from taking the bus at all. Categorizing the anomalies enables Gui to provide the notifications that fit the context of the user’s commute. \n<p>\nMeasuring occupancy: <p>\nObject detection models built on top Tensorflow allow Gui to count objects from any input camera feed. These objects include people, cars, and bicycles. The Tensorflow model leverages convolutional neural networks, a machine learning technique that identifies the shapes and associates them the objects that need to be identified.

There seem to be a lot of opportunities for identifying new sources of information, and extracting insights using AI.

Tokenizing assets in this way allows goods to be traded as close to directly as possible, potentially even without the abstraction of government-issued (fiat) money in the future.This represents a fundamental shift in how projects and ventures are funded, providing a new level of speed (time to liquidity) security (immutable public record), and accessibility (open to anyone with internet access) to investing in future projects. \n\nAs more and more tangible and intangible assets become tokenized and exchanged on the blockchain, several implications emerge for the financial sector.\n\nThe internet already increased liquidity by opening up competitive online marketplaces with more people and volume for exchanging goods/services. Tokenizing assets on a blockchain extends this trend, allowing for the tokenization and exchange of new types of assets and providing a huge liquidity premium. This means more types of goods and services can be ‘securitized’ and traded openly between a wider pool of investors.\n\nWhen venture capitalists and early stage investors fund startups, their contribution quickly becomes illiquid as it is tied up for several years and not allowed to be traded. Selling tokens to raise money allows this investment to be traded on the open market within days or weeks. This represents a huge change in how venture capital works today.\nTokenization will cause major disruption to the status quo, meaning traditional financial models like securities lending may not work the same way in a blockchain future. The current system will have to grow and evolve to meet these changes and stakeholders who benefit from the status quo today will have to adopt new methods to continue to reap rewards.\n\nBut unlike traditional investment markets with both a long history of standards, consumer protections and a range of tools for investors of any level to aggregate, manage, and exchange investment products through simple user-interfaces and websites, crypto-investing is brand new and fragmented, spread out over a variety of platforms, services and tools with varying levels of usability. While the number of people interested in crypto-assets is increasing, either as an investment opportunity or for future use, it is still intimidating for new users to get started and for experienced investors to aggregate the existing tools and services they use into one seamless user experience. \n\nIt’s hard for users to understand where their assets live and who has ownership over them, so today, users trade off security for easier to use platforms.  Due to the somewhat unforgiving cryptographic roots of this technology (public and private pairs) it’s easy for users to lose access to their assets completely. The platforms that address this issue specifically trade the cryptographic security features for an easy to navigate UI built on traditional centralized digital architectures that are fundamentally insecure..\n\nBeyond that, tokens are a brand-new asset class that is hard to define and even more difficult to categorize in terms of risk and reward. Since each token can fundamentally represent a different product/service/currency/investment tool, it is hard for both users and regulators to understand what they do and the financial risk/reward they carry. For this reason, it is difficult users to make financial decisions and even harder for regulators to make policy decisions that adequately protect consumers yet allow them the freedom to invest in new ways.\n\nEven with these challenges, the exchange of tokenized goods and services over blockchain networks will become a critical part of our future, and our token portfolios will emerge as important indicators of both our financial and philosophical preferences for where we generate and store our value. Tokens have the potential to create a strong foundation for the reputation economy we already see emerging (sharing economy) facilitating more direct and organic connections between people and projects. They are more than just money, they represent our interest, affiliation, and connection with projects and ideas and as more and more people realize this, our world will radically transform. This future is starting now, and IZR’s goal is to empower as many as possible to have a stake in deciding how it is created."

        "body" : "During our crypto-wallets sprint we brainstormed multiple methods of creating more low friction methods of investing in cryptocurrency, focusing on wallet types and onboarding methods as a place where design is heavily needed to become a standardized experience.\n\nBitpool arouse after discussing what might happen if we create a cryptocurrency wallet storage application that was purely for depositing and withdrawal. In this method, the user could deposit local currency funds into an account that would then buy cryptocurrency coins on their behalf. The distributions could possibly be adjusted, but in certain cases, the user might not want to be burdened with knowing exactly what they're investing in, just that the money that they deposit is being invested in crypto of some type. With that in mind, what would happen if we took that thought to more of an extreme?\n\nBitpool presents a new abstracted way of investing in cryptocurrency. You are presented with an empty tide pool, a bare ecosystem in place for you to build on. You can diversify the ecosystem by strategically \"buying\" elements in increments of $1, $2, or $5 that you believe will benefit the pool. You can also choose to create a flat deposit of money into your pool, say, $250, to create a new type of fish to put inside of your pool. Over time, certain creatures that you add can multiply, and as they do, your pool's worth grows. Just the same, certain creatures may be bad for the ecosystem, or become a victim of natural selection, and your pool's worth can shrink. At any time, you can withdraw your funds from the pool and deposit them back into your bank account using a net to scoop out some of your fish.\n\nSo what's actually happening here? The currency that you \"spend\" is deposited through a linked bank account, and is deposited into your pool's funds, which is actually multiple exchange cryptocurrency wallets. You pool's value is the total holding value of your crypto shown in your local currency. Depositing is as easy and fun as buying new creatures for your pool. You can also make a flat deposit, and see your investment stick around inside of your pool. Withdrawing takes fish away from your pool and transfers currency out of your wallets to be exchange for your local currency and then is deposited back to your linked bank account. Withdrawing currency from your wallet or making a deposit may incur network or exchange fees which you are notified of at the time of the transaction (just like any transfer on an exchange or within network chains). You can also choose to manage your distributions or how your currency is invested, affecting what percentages of your deposits get invested into what currencies.",

When overlaid with city GIS data such as zoning, construction permit applications, or business data from facebook, Three Things starts to show correlations among data patterns for certain streets and areas.\n\nTrends and historical patterns can be used to predict future change: has a certain area evolved from being the center of trade in a downtown location to now becoming more residential due to a new improvement a street over?

From 2015-16, the U.S. advertising market grew by 19% -- but only because Google and Facebook had crazy successful years. If you exclude those two players, the rest-of-market actually *contracted* by 2%.\n\nWe designed two-sided marketplace and compete with Google and Facebook on their own home turf. To achieve that vision, we needed to start small. And, after some pivoting and pivoting some more, we believe the first opportunity is in cryptographically-verified email analytics for crypto-newsletters.\n\n<br/><br/>Rosetta begins with a javascript snippet that can cryptographically track key email metrics (e.g., clicks on a button, opens, subscribers, view time). Think of it like a \"crypto-pixel\" that can easily track activity in the digital world and record it on a blockchain. \n<br><br>Crypto-newsletter publishers often don't trust the metrics that MailChimp or Google give them. Today, metrics often they often conflict with each other -- so newsletter publishers love \"double-verification\" (their words) of key metrics. Rosetta enables true metrics tracking, along with the ability to benchmark against competitors without sacrificing privacy. Rosetta enables via a public ranking system by taking pseudonymous data captured by our blockchain and making it more readily visible and interactable. .\n\n<br/><br/>Once we achieve a critical mass of email newsletter publishers on the platform, we will expand to a buy/sell marketplace for ads. The pixel we developed could easily expand to be a container for an ad. Then, once you have publishers and advertisers, you have the market you need to go for the <strike>gold</strike> bitcoin.",

Customers would create a service contract with a contractor agreeing to have services provided while putting money upfront in escrow for the service and the products. The contract created between a customer and the contractor serves as a auditable document that shows a proof of services giving the supplier confidence to provide the product on credit and create a contract with the contractor. Once services are rendered by the contractor, the escrow would pay out to the contractor and supplier. ",

        "body" : "Promise is a smart contract app for service providers that puts the details of their contract onto a blockchain, enabling them to finance their inventory.\n\nImagine an electrician is just starting out and haven't established a history of work yet. They need to get products to complete a job with a new customer but don't have any money to buy the materials.  Most banks don't offer credit in this scenario, or charge high interest. As a result it becomes difficult for electricians to take on these jobs.\n\n <br><br> Using Promise, once an electrician signs up a customer, they can draft and send a contract for approval. The customer would get an SMS message that the contract has been created and they can review it by a link provided in the message that sends them to Promise.  <br><br>Unlike traditional contract management, the Promise app prompts customers to pay their deposit up front, but ensures that that money stays in escrow until the services are completed. Once the electrician and customer agree on terms, the customer sends money to an escrow account. <br><br>\n\nWith that contract (digitally) in hand, electricians can now go to a supplier and buy products on credit. Suppliers can easily audit the electrician's contracts to reduce the risk of handing over inventory on credit. Beyond audits, Promise lets manufacturers create new contracts with the electrician, that link directly to the electrician's contract with the customer. When one is paid, the other automatically acts to pay back the manufacturer. Once the job is finished and both the electrician and the customer verify that it has been completed then the escrow pays out. If there is a dispute then Promise initiates an arbitration process, and the money is held in escrow until a decision is made. \n <br><br>\nAs the contractor completes more jobs successfully their credit increases potentially allowing him to be able to purchase products at discounts or additional credit without the need for having any contracts in the future.  <br><br>\nPromise could revolutionize financing for small businesses, and create more transparency for individuals. Customers could know that their funds/deposits were used to pay for  their jobs, electricians could access new inventory and scale their business, and manufacturers could sell more goods.",

        "why" : "The project was built to solve a problem of allowing contractors that had little to no credit-worthiness obtain some kind of financing or products on credit from suppliers or other parties, so as to be able to do business. The request was made that we create something that was auditable and that ensured that pricing between the supplier and customer / supplier and contractor was masked so as not to risk the release of any information that would lead to any loss of competitive advantage between the parties. \n\nWhen looking at the problem we realized that the challenge was one of confidence between the parties. Why would a supplier provide any equipment to a contractor on credit? The thought was that if we can use smart contracts between the contractor and the customer (with an escrow amount being specified in the contract) as a proof of service to be carried out and ability to pay, then the supplier might want to provide the products to the contractor on credit.  The promise of payment along with a binding contract that presents proof of a job that is to be carried out, might give the supplier enough confidence to provide the contractor with the materials he needs."

Carfax maintains a centralized database that provides buyers and sellers with a vehicle history but the problems with this include questions of accuracy and the methods of data collection. \n\nWe wanted to understand how Carfax works. What information do they provide? How do they collect data? What is their value proposition? What is the user experience like? What we found is that Carfax collects data from a number of third-party sources but primarily relies on insurance companies (accident reports, stolen vehicle records), DMVs (titles, registration, ownership transfers, accident reports, inspection records, etc.), and dealer/repair shops (odometer readings, vehicle sales). Carfax’s marketing strategy preys upon the suspicions of buyers on the used car marketplace.\n\nWe conducted interviews with people with experience buying and selling used cars. We learned where Carfax fit in their process of buying and selling, what information they expected to see at every step of the process, and the additional steps they took before completing a deal. This is where it became apparent that viewing the Carfax report is seen as mandatory for many potential buyers in the used car marketplace but also that many seller supplied additional maintenance records. The buyers we spoke to mentioned and described the additional records as more effective than the Carfax report in building trust in their counterpart.\n\nWe came up with blockchain technology for cars called SweetChain. With blockchain technology we utilize smart contracts to store driving data on leased or rented cars. This allows a car's driving history to be continuously updated and transactions for rental cars to be executed without the need for humans. In addition, it also protects the privacy of drivers. We tested this technology with two main use cases shown below.\n\nOur app called FutureCast gives owners a way to participate in a network of shared information about the car that they are driving (compared to others of same make, model and year) with the strongest incentive to them being access to an easy-to-maintain system of tracking their own car’s history and maintenance. We learned in our user research that many drivers/sellers on the used car marketplace maintain such records to preserve their resale value and build trust with potential buyers. \n\nFutureCast is also a response to the questions of accuracy in the Carfax reports. The physical component, which attaches to a car’s OBD port, collects data without any need for user input, minimizing opportunities for bad data. The OBD port automatically stores the car's information on the blockchain. Therefore, if there a car gets into an accident this information is stored on the blockchain. Then, users are incentivized to amend this information with accurate data that will strengthen the knowledge of the network and provide a more complete representation of their vehicle’s condition.\n\nWe learned that buyers feel that obtaining a Carfax report is necessary, even if incomplete. A single Carfax report costs $40 but our interviews also uncovered a common practice where sellers will pay for and provide the report to interested buyers. In response to this, FutureCast looks to provide data that is not contained in the Carfax report and gives owners an opportunity to give a more complete history of how their car has been driven and maintained.\n\nFutureCast does not make Carfax obsolete but a mass adoption of the application could decrease buyer reliance on the Carfax report as the sole source of historical information on a used car.\n\nSweetRide differentiates itself from other car borrowing platforms by using machine learning as a way to track and reward safe driving habits. It also allows people to create immutable forms of data via smart contracts that are formed on the BlockChain.",

Brella offers low variable premiums based on flight price, with an interactive tool to check premium and payouts after entering ticket purchasing. Travelers have options of when and how to engage with Brella. To purchase Brella insurance whenever they are booking a flight, travelers can enable a Chrome extension, which activates at the point of purchase of a flight on an airline website. Additionally, there is a Brella credit card option. For an annual membership fee based on your travel preferences, we offer three credit cards: a smart traveler, avid traveler, and wayfaring traveler; all which provide a variety of coverage for delays and cancellations. \n\nPart of the underlying technology that powers Brella is an algorithmically generated risk score, which represents the likelihood and magnitude of a flight delay or cancellation. This score uses historical data such as departure/arrival times, airport/airline, and weather, and includes machine learning horsepower to help Brella price premiums and provide insight to our customers to make informed decisions.\n",

Holiday season).", "People are motivated by low cost premiums and it does not scale proportionally to flight cost. “Delays feel the same regardless of the flight cost”", "Payouts should be paid out continuously (calculated by the minute), not at discrete intervals (1 hr and 3 hr). People do not want to hope for a longer delay, a continuous payout eliminates this desire to some extent. ", "The business is viable based on using average values from the DoT. We modeled the finances for a tiered structure, flat fee, and variable fee. The prices and payouts were in the ranges that would motivate people to purchase this insurance.", "It's unclear still whether the risk score for each flight should be made public, to help customers make flight/insurance decisions, or kept private, as insurance companies do today, to avoid discouraging people from buying insurance on low-risk flights.", "There is a fine line between decentralized p2p insurance and betting/gambling." ],
        "why" : "Flight delays and cancellations are common annoyances travelers face. We can’t make up for missing a life event or being late to a meeting but we think Brella can ease the pain a bit. By leveraging novel Smart Contract technology, Brella allows customers to get paid when they are delayed or canceled without them having to submit any claims. Because we don’t have to hire people to process claims, this means instant payout and lower premium fees. All payouts accrue by the minute once your delay begins and are sent upon the Smart Contract’s automatic confirmation of flight takeoff and delay time. The first payout starts at 1 hour delay and maxes out at 6 hour delay.\n\nBecause Brella is powered by a peer-to-peer insurance model, this allows customers to purchase affordable premiums and receive better payouts. Beyond building the infrastructure for insurance service, we are building a community of travelers. The cost of coverage goes to a common pool to cover payouts for all of the members. Purchasing Brella means you can protect yourself while protecting others. At the end of the year, any money left in the pool goes back to our valued members.\n"

        "body" : "CityMatch is a tool to intuitively compare changes in a city with other cities according to different parameters. The intent of comparing cities relating different variables to a given change takes into consideration the empathy aspect of how a city feels like to each user. The data can then be consumed in a more relatable and faster way. It's easier for us to grasp how a new development will impact a city when we visualize, for example, that a change in Redwood City would cause new traffic level that it would make it look like Mountain View or if a change in public transportation will make it more similar to Palo Alto. It doesn't necessarily require having a high usability index, but rather to have a better way for people to understand how a proposed change transforms a current place or system.<br><br>\nThis tool not only serves as a communicative presentation tool for non-expert users, but also can serve as a formative addition to the architect/urban planner's design process. By reframing the question from optimizing a specific parameter as defined by a client to thinking about how a design or development change evokes an intangible sense of place, this tool allows designers to think about change beyond conceptual models and numbers (i.e. applying a more \"human-centered\" approach to the urban designer/architect's design process). We define 10 sliding input variables (which arguably have greatest impact on determining how a neighborhood \"feels\") for each neighborhood in our user interface, which allows for intuitive engagement and easily iterative application. <br><br>\n\nWe leverage rich vector space embedding of cities with temporally coherent datasets to estimate the impacts of changes to those cities, and generalize those changes in such a way as to afford easy assessment of the impacts of similar changes in other cities. The tool is designed to be dataset agnostic, meaning that any city data, or even non city data, with arbitrary dimensionality, can be leveraged in a similar manner. We believe that the more data that is added to this model, the more useful it will be.<br><br>\n\nFurthermore the features we demonstrated about communicating changes to a city through a map projection use style transfer through deep learning to show how the stylistic elements of one environment would augment another environment.",

For visually impaired or screen free users, Cleo enables an entirely new way to surf and skim audio websites developed through Trala. \n\nCleo was inspired by the main pain-point of screen-readers: how might we reimagine the experience of browsing the content of a website in a manner that is inherently non-visual and screen free, so that visually impaired or screen-less users experience all the richness of the site without a loss of fidelity to the content? While the normal experience of the internet is limited to the two-dimensional actions of point-and-click, scroll, and visual cues, Cleo brings Trala’s audio browsing experience to life by imagining a screen-free experience of the web. \n\nCleo was designed to enable a specific set of gestures that screen readers make difficult. Firstly, it allows a user to skim through content summaries as one might visually skim the text on a page. Secondly, it enables a user to ‘skim’ the actions and links on a page in a separate menu, which reimagines the spatially-situated “call-to-action” buttons on websites. Finally, while a screen reader would use an automated voice to read through chunks of text, Cleo works with Trala’s developer kit to provide users with a podcast-quality sound experience complete with branding through background music and human voice acting. On the Myo, Cleo allows the user to scroll through the page for content, using hand gestures while performing tasks that require both hands like cooking. Using the wii-inspired remote control, Cleo allows users to navigate the content non-linearly using click-wheel-like sliders and wii-inspired trigger buttons.",

        "body" : "Chain Reaction is a system to triangulate camera \"sightings\" of vehicles under Amber Alert.<br><br>\nDespite being a system built around incidents of paramount importance — a child abduction — the current Amber Alert system isn’t fulling leveraging the participation of civilians. Currently, the program is based on mobile phone alerts for opted-in participants and highway billboards.\n<br><br>\nTaking action on an Amber Alert or another alert of its kind requires civilians to keep their eyes peeled and remember a long sequence of numbers. This poses a number of obstacles for many people that do want to help. A high barrier for participation lends itself to a number of unintended consequences: distracted driving, good samaritan apathy, and ultimately low participation rates.\n<br><br>\nChainReaction leverages the wealth of vehicle data available to be passively collected by the general public in order to assist in the recovery of abducted children.\n<br><br>\nOur prototype uses open-source\nOCR technology to recognize\nlicense plates, pushing the car’s\nlocation to a blockchain\nmiddleware only in the event of a\nmatch with an ongoing amber\nalert.<br><br>\nWe replicated a dashcam/rear\nview camera with a web cam,\ntesting it out with images of street\nscenes with visible license plates.\nAdditionally, all cars under 10,000\npounds will be required to have a\nrear-view camera following May\n2018. This alowed us to have a\npretty good idea of what was\nfeasible. This in addition to\nexisting after-market add-ons\nsuch as the Nexar Dashcam allow\nusers to use their own cellphones\nas a dashcam.\n<br><br>\nFurthermore, we surfaced the data through a web\ninterface intended for use by law enforcement\nagents. The interface allowed law enforcement\nagents to see hits on Amber Alerts in real time,\ndisplaying geographic information in connection\nwith specific plates and cases. The information was\ndisplayed through an interactive map, and cases\nwere searchable to allow for a more specific view\non hits for a specific case over time.\nThrough a civilian opt-in system similar to the\nmobile Amber Alert system of today, the platform\nopens up access to crowd-sourced data through\navenues currently as a whole inaccessible by any\nsingle party. This gives value to the data that any\nperson can collect and provides structure for the\ndata to be passed between parties.\nAlthough not crucial to the structure of the\nprototype and the platform in general, having\na blockchain middleware allowed for several\nbenefits.<br><br>\nIn interviewing law enforcement, we\nunderstood that there existed multiple\nbarriers to trust in creating a system that aided\nlaw-enforcement. People were concerned\nabout how their information was being\nhandled and accessed. A distributed ledger\nsystem allowed for more transparency in the\nstructure. Additionally, with a larger source of\ndata, hashing could provide a layer of\nanonymity for data providers. Multiple hits on\nthe same location from multiple sources\nbolster information in ways single-source tips\ncan not, while still allowing room for the\nprovider’s identity to be concealed. This is a\nvast improvement for all parties compared to\nthe current system, where tippers for Amber\nAlerts need to be personally verified by law\nenforcement personnel.<br><br>\nAdditionally, a distributed ledger system\nprovides a much lower cost barrier for\nimplementation than a centrally hosted\ndatabase. This would allow different\njurisdictions to have more leeway in their\nability to use the system, rather than having a\nlarge cost upfront.",

Gradually allowing for\nadditional players to enter the marketplace\noutside of different law enforcement\nentities would allow the data to take on\nmore value and be reused in multiple\ncontexts.<br><br>\nWith the creation of a crowd-sourced data\nsharing platform with future plans of\nopening into a wider marketplace, the initial\nproviding of civilian data could pressure\nadditional entities to enter the marketplace,\nboth as purchasers and as providers.\nCreating competition regarding data could\nshift OEMs’ protection of the data they\ncollect by allowing them to assess with an\nimmediate monetary value.<br><br>\nAdditionally, thinking towards a future of\nautonomous vehicles data collection might\nshift from driver opt-in to fleet manager optin.\nThis would have interesting implications\nin how data is managed and owned."

Given a specific car and day of the week, we can find the destinations of that car, and furthermore, the energy required to reach all of those destinations. Given that calculation, we can allocate the required amount of power for driving to the car, and use the rest for energy arbitrage. ",
